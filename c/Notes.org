* Formatting with printf
- %d is used for integers
- %ld is written for long integers
- you can give width to right adjust your output
  like %3d.
- to format floating point numbers use
  - %`digits_before`.`digits_after_decimalpoint`f`
  - %3.0f will print 3 digits without any point
  - %3.2f will print 3 digits before and 2 digits after decimal point.
* getchar() takes one character at a time and putchar() prints one character at a time.
- we use int to store the the symbol `EOF` which is bigger than any char type.
* Start from page 35
