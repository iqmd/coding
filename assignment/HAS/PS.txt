You are building a home automation system that controls various smart devices. Each device can have multiple operations, such as turning on/off, adjusting brightness, and changing colors. Implement the Command design pattern to create a system that can execute different commands on these devices.

Create a command interface Command that declares an execute method for performing the device operation.

Implement concrete command classes for the following operations:

TurnOnCommand: Turns on the device.
TurnOffCommand: Turns off the device.
AdjustBrightnessCommand: Adjusts the brightness of the device.
ChangeColorCommand: Changes the color of the device.
Create receiver classes for different smart devices like Light, Fan, and Thermostat, each implementing the necessary operations.

Finally, create a remote control class RemoteControl that can store and execute the commands. The remote control should have methods to add commands, remove commands, and execute the commands.
