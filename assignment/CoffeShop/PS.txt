You are developing a system for a coffee shop that allows customers to order different types of coffee with various add-ons. Implement the Decorator design pattern to create a flexible and extensible system for handling coffee orders.

Your base coffee class should have the following properties and methods:

abstract class Coffee {
String description;

abstract double cost();

String getDescription() {
return description;
}
}


You should have three types of coffee:

Espresso: A basic espresso coffee costs $2.50.
Latte: A latte is a coffee with milk. It costs $3.50.
Cappuccino: A cappuccino is a coffee with equal parts of espresso, milk, and frothed milk. It costs $4.00.
Additionally, you should have three add-ons:

Milk: Adding milk to the coffee costs $0.50.
Whipped Cream: Adding whipped cream to the coffee costs $1.00.
Caramel: Adding caramel to the coffee costs $1.50.
Implement the decorator classes for each add-on and coffee types, and demonstrate how you can create different coffee orders with different combinations of add-ons.
