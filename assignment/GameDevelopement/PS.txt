You are working on a game development project, and you need to implement a system for creating and managing different types of game characters. Implement the Prototype design pattern to create a flexible system for cloning and modifying game characters.

Create an abstract base class GameCharacter that declares an abstract method clone to create a copy of the character. Implement concrete subclasses for different types of game characters: Warrior, Mage, and Archer.

Each game character should have attributes like name, health, and attack power.

Demonstrate how the Prototype design pattern can be used to clone and modify game characters in your application.
