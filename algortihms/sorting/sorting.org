#+title: Sorting

* Comparison models


* Integer Sorting (Non-comparison models)
- We use the power of RAM (random access machines) to access any element in constant time to sort in linear time.
- We assume that we are only sorting integers.
- Those integers are only positive numbers.
- Integer sorting is still in research
** Counting Sort
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
L = array of k empty lists
for j in range(n):
    L(key(A[j])).append(A[j])
output = []
for i in range(k):
    output.extend(L[i])
  #+END_SRC






** Radix Sort
- It uses counting sort as a subroutine.
- Break integer into a bunch of columns as in base b
- digits = d = logbK
- sort the elements by the least siginificant to digits
- then next...
- then next...
- till the most significant digits.
- And we sort them by counting sort.
